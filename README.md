International Innovation and Invention Competition Through Exhibition 2023
Our project titled Detection of Heavy Metal Ions Using a Screening Device with Smartphone and Graphene Quantum Dots.
- I am tasked to create an algorithm using Python with OpenCV library to identity different ions and their hazard level. I had to use OpenCV to obtain the RBG value of the Graphene Quantum Dots and with the help of Logistic Regression, the algorithm is able to predict the types and hazardous level of the substance
